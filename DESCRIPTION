Title: Estimating Trend, Velocity and Acceleration from Sea Level
        Records
Version: 1.0
Depends: R (>= 3.2.2)
Date: 2019-08-05
Description: Analysis of annual average ocean water level time series, providing
    improved estimates of trend (mean sea level) and associated real-time velocities and
    accelerations. Improved trend estimates are based on singular spectrum analysis
    methods. Various gap-filling options are included to accommodate incomplete time
    series records. The package also includes a range of diagnostic tools to inspect
    the components comprising the original time series which enables expert
    interpretation and selection of likely trend components. A wide range of
    screen and plot to file options are available in the package.
